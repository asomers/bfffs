[details]
The FUSE protocol requires a file system's getxattr operation to return
ERANGE if the attribute's value can't fit in the size requested by the
client.  That's contrary to how FreeBSD's getextattr(2) works and contrary
to how BFFFS's Fs::getextattr works.  It's also hard to trigger during
normal use, because the kernel first asks for the size of the attribute.  So
during normal use, this error can only be the result of a race.

Currently, bfffs's Fs::getattr operation wrongly truncates the value if the
requested size is insufficient.
