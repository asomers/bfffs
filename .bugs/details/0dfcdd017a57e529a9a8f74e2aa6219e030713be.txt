[details]
On a cache miss, IDML::move_record reads from disk, decompressing as usual. 
Then it writes the record back to a new location.  It would be better if it
never decompressed the record.  Since checksums are calculated on the compressed
record, rather than the uncompressed record, this should be possible.
