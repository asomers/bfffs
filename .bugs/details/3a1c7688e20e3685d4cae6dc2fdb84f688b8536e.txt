[details]
The current range_delete_pass2 algorithm can't fix all underflow problems.
In particular, if after the descent phase there is an underflowing node who
is its parent's only child, then that node can't be fixed.  If it wasn't an
only child during descent, then it wouldn't be fixed then.

It's not clear how to fix this bug.
