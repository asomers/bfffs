[details]
Occasionally Database::check will fail, printing a bunch of errors like:

Indirect block 828 has no reverse mapping in the allocation table.
Entry=RidtEntry { drp: DRP { pba: PBA { cluster: 0, lba: 1727 },
compression: None, lsize: 664, csize: 664, checksum: 1342528341693631180 },
refcount: 1 }
Indirect block 829 has no reverse mapping in the allocation table.
Entry=RidtEntry { drp: DRP { pba: PBA { cluster: 0, lba: 1728 },
compression: None, lsize: 2048, csize: 2048, checksum: 5069491788013618357
}, refcount: 1 }
...
Indirect block 907 has no reverse mapping in the allocation table.
Entry=RidtEntry { drp: DRP { pba: PBA { cluster: 0, lba: 1798 },
compression: None, lsize: 365, csize: 365, checksum: 11318914562305102016 },
refcount: 1 }

This error is grave, because it means those blocks cannot be relocated and
may be accidentally erased by a clean_zone operation.

[reproduce]
I have seen this occasionally from the clean_zone_leak test.  But it's
easier to reproduce with the FS Torture test.
1) Disable the timed syncer.  In Database.rs, method Syncer::run, change the
   delay duration to some very large number.
2) Run "cargo test common::fs::torture::no_reverse_map --ignored --nocapture"
