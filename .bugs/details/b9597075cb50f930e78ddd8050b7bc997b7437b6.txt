Revision 768:6805b1abde4a caused range_delete_pass2 to attempt to fix an
in-danger node repeatedly until the danger goes away.  This fixed a bug
whereby fixing a child could cause the parent to underflow.  However, it's
possible that the child can't be fixed to the exacting standard demanded
(min_fanout + 2).  In that case, fixit() will infinitely loop in the
future::loop_fn statement.
