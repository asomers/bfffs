[details]
Single disk configurations still use the VdevRaid module, but with the
NullRaid locator.  This locator has a chunk size of 1.  That makes VdevRaid
unnecessarily split all I/O operations into sglists of 4KB elements.  That
sucks.  It must be fixed, either by doing something more intelligent in
NullRaid, or by bypassing VdevRaid altogether for nonredundant clusters.

[reproduce]
Run `gstat -a` while also running the fio benchmark with the record size set
to something greater than 4KB.  gstat will show that all I/O is still done
4.0KB at a time.
